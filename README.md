  ## Description
  This is a React-based single-page portfolio application designed to highlight my latest projects as a developer. Its purpose is twofold: to showcase my recent work and to serve as a platform for me to delve into my newly acquired React expertise. When users access the portfolio, they will be greeted with an About Me landing page and a navigation bar. The navigation bar facilitates easy access to sections dedicated to showcasing my projects, displaying my resume, and providing a contact form. Furthermore, the footer at the bottom of the page includes icons that link to my different social media profiles for additional contact options.
